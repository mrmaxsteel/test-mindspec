description: Set up a mindspec review panel (step 0 — dir + BRIEF + panel.json) then launch 6 reviewers (3 Claude Agents + 3 Codex CLI sessions) in parallel and wait for verdicts
---

# Run a 6-Reviewer Panel

Step 0 creates the panel directory, the BRIEF.md the reviewers read, and the `panel.json` state file the in-binary `mindspec complete` gate and `mindspec instruct --panel-state` consume. Then fan out three `Agent` calls (Claude) and three `codex exec` background processes (Codex) in parallel. Each writes a JSON verdict to disk. Wait for all six, then hand off to `/ms-panel-tally`.

Step 0 was previously the separate `/ms-panel-create` skill; it is folded in here so the panel directory, BRIEF, and `panel.json` are always created together — the gate's source of truth (`panel.json`) cannot be forgotten.

## Inputs

- `panel-slug` (required) — e.g. `spec-050-bead2` (round 1) or `spec-050-bead2-r2` (round 2).
- `target` (required) — one of `bead <bead-id>`, `pr <pr-number>`, or `commit <sha>`. For `/ms-spec-final-review`, `target` is the spec branch (`bead_id` null).
- `round` (default `1`) — the panel round; reviewers write to `<slot>-round-<N>.json`.
- `expected-reviewers` (default `6`) — the default panel size.

## Step 0 — create panel dir + BRIEF + panel.json

1. **Create the panel directory.**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p <repo>/review/<panel-slug>
   ```

2. **Write `panel.json`** — the single source of truth the pre-complete gate (ADR-0037) and `mindspec instruct --panel-state` read. Schema:

   ```json
   {
     "bead_id": "<bead-id>",        // null for non-bead targets (final-review / PR panels)
     "spec": "<spec-slug>",
     "target": "<bead/<id> | spec/<slug> | pr/<n> | <sha>>",
     "round": 1,
     "expected_reviewers": 6,
     "reviewed_head_sha": "<git rev-parse of the target ref at fan-out>"
   }
   ```

   `reviewed_head_sha` is `git rev-parse` of the target ref (`bead/<id>` for a bead panel, the spec branch tip for a final-review panel) captured NOW, at fan-out.

   **On every re-panel, bump `round` AND `reviewed_head_sha` in the SAME write.** The two fields move together by construction — never write one without the other. A re-panel that bumps `round` but leaves a stale `reviewed_head_sha` (or vice versa) is exactly the stale-verdict bypass the gate exists to close (lola-f4a8 class).

   Optional fields the abandon procedure (`/ms-panel-tally` § halt-recover) sets: `"abandoned": true` plus `"abandon_reason": "<who/why>"` (required when abandoned).

3. **Compose the BRIEF.md.** Required sections:

   ```markdown
   # <panel-slug> — Round <N> Review Panel

   **Worktree**: <abs-path-to-bead-worktree>
   **Branch**: bead/<bead-id> | spec/<slug> | pr/<n>
   **Commit under review**: <sha> — <commit subject>
   **Prior round verdict** (round >= 2 only): X APPROVE, Y REQUEST_CHANGES; consolidated asks below.

   ## What the work does

   <1-paragraph plain-English summary. Don't paste the plan; summarise it.>

   ## Round-<N-1> concrete_changes_required (consolidated)  [round >= 2]

   1. ...
   2. ...

   ## Files in scope (final state at <sha>)

   - `path/to/file.py`
   - ...

   ## Shared modules reused (unchanged)

   - `app/entities/identify.py` — `IdentifyResultCase1/2/3`, `identify_via_llm`, ...

   ## Fix-author deviations (assess these explicitly)  [round >= 2]

   A. <deviation 1 — why the author diverged from the brief, and what they did instead>
   B. ...

   ## Your job

   Verify the round-<N-1> concrete_changes_required are addressed (round >= 2), or evaluate the work cold (round 1). Each ask → ADDRESSED / PARTIAL / MISSED / NEW_ISSUE.

   Verdict: APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / REJECT.

   Output JSON to `<repo>/review/<panel-slug>/<your-slot>-round-<N>.json` with keys:
   `reviewer_id`, `verdict`, `confidence`, `rationale` (≤200 words), `concrete_changes_required` (empty if APPROVE), `findings` (per round-<N-1> item). An artifact-gate finding may set `"hard_block": true`.
   ```

4. **Pre-stage the codex prompts.** Codex CLI sessions cannot accept the BRIEF as a tool input the way Claude `Agent` calls can. Write `/tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r{4,5,6}.md` files, each opening with:
   > You are R{N} codex on the <panel-slug> round-<round> verification panel. Read `<abs-path>/BRIEF.md`.

   followed by the slot-specific lens, the previous-round JSON path (round >= 2), and the concrete_changes_required items they personally raised in the previous round.

## Launch the panel

1. **Launch Codex first** (they run 4-10 min vs Claude 1-3 min; start the slow ones first).

   For each codex slot R4, R5, R6:
   - The `/tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<N>.md` prompt (from step 0) tells the reviewer to read `<repo>/review/<panel-slug>/BRIEF.md`, names the slot id (`R4 codex`, etc.) and the lens, and for round >= 2 points at the previous round's JSON.

     **Prompt MUST include this terminal instruction verbatim:**

     ```
     Your final step before terminating is to WRITE the verdict JSON to `<EXPECTED_JSON>` using a `Write` tool call (or a single-file patch). Do NOT terminate after just composing the verdict in your output — the orchestrator reads the file, not the log. If you cannot write to that exact path (sandbox or permissions), STOP and write a short error message to the same path describing why.
     ```

     Codex without this instruction reliably "finishes thinking" without writing — particularly when its working directory is outside the panel JSON path's sandbox.
   - Launch (always `cd <repo>` first — see "Working directory matters" below). Use a SINGLE source of backgrounding — the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true`. **No** trailing `&`, **no** `nohup` wrapper:
     ```bash
     cd <repo>
     codex exec --skip-git-repo-check < /tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<N>.md > /tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<N>.out 2>&1
     ```
     Tool call shape: `Bash` with the command above and `run_in_background: true`. The Bash tool backgrounds the process itself and fires a `<task-notification>` when codex actually exits.

   > **Anti-pattern: do NOT double-background codex.**
   >
   > The combination `nohup bash -c '...' &` + `run_in_background: true` puts codex into two layers of background. The shell-level `&` returns immediately, so the Bash tool's task-notification fires on bash-exit (~1 sec), not codex-exit (~5–10 min). The orchestrator then reads an empty output file and falsely concludes codex failed.
   >
   > Pick ONE source of backgrounding. Recommended: the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true` — it gives you a real `<task-notification>` when codex actually exits, plus a clean path to grep the output log via `Read` (or, for log-extraction recovery per the "Codex failure detection" section below, via `codex_verdict_extract.sh`).
   >
   > If you must shell-background instead (e.g. to capture `$!` for explicit PID tracking), drop `run_in_background: true` from the Bash tool call so the tool returns synchronously after the `&` — then poll separately. This path is harder; default to the tool-level backgrounding.

2. **Launch Claude `Agent`s second** (faster; start after Codex is already running).

   For each claude slot R1, R2, R3:
   - Compose a prompt with the BRIEF path, slot id, lens, and required JSON output path.
   - Spawn a `general-purpose` `Agent` with `run_in_background: true`.

3. **Wait for completion notifications.** Each finishes asynchronously; you receive `<task-notification>` messages. Don't poll outputs — wait for the notification.

4. **Detect codex failures.** See "Codex failure detection (deterministic)" below.

5. **Verify all six JSON files exist** at `<repo>/review/<panel-slug>/<slot>-round-<N>.json`.

## Codex failure detection (deterministic)

A healthy codex run writes its JSON verdict to the named output path. Failure modes: codex hit its usage limit, codex tried to write but the sandbox rejected the path, or codex "finished thinking" without ever attempting a write. Detect each deterministically — the original v1 check used `"Output JSON to"` in the log as a healthy-ack signal, but that string is just codex echoing the prompt back; it appears even when the file never lands. Use three layers instead, in order.

**Pre-condition: honest task-notification timing.** This check is only reliable when the `<task-notification>` fires on *codex* exit, not on a shell-wrapper exit. That requires single-source backgrounding (see launch step 1 above) — drop `&` and `nohup`; use only the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true`. The earlier double-backgrounded pattern made the file-existence primary check race against still-running codex, producing false "completed in 1 sec, file empty" reports. With the timing honest, layer 1 below is reliable on first read.

```bash
EXPECTED_JSON="<repo>/review/<panel-slug>/codex-<slot>-round-<N>.json"
OUT="/tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<slot>.out"

# Layer 1 (primary): did the file land?
if [ -f "$EXPECTED_JSON" ]; then
    : # healthy, nothing to do
elif grep -q "ERROR: You've hit your usage limit" "$OUT"; then
    # codex hit usage limit — sub claude
    launch_claude_sub_for_slot <slot>
elif grep -qE "apply patch|patch: completed|\+\+\+ " "$OUT"; then
    # Layer 2 (diagnostic): codex *tried* to write but file is absent → sandbox path issue
    echo "WARN: codex attempted file-write but sandbox rejected — check workdir vs $EXPECTED_JSON"
    # Layer 3 (recovery): extract verdict from log
    extract_verdict_from_log "$OUT" > "$EXPECTED_JSON" \
      || launch_claude_sub_for_slot <slot>
else
    # codex finished thinking without ever attempting a write
    # Layer 3 (recovery): try log extraction first; sub if nothing extractable
    extract_verdict_from_log "$OUT" > "$EXPECTED_JSON" \
      || launch_claude_sub_for_slot <slot>
fi
```

`extract_verdict_from_log` is the helper script shipped alongside this skill:

```bash
extract_verdict_from_log() {
    "$MINDSPEC_PLUGIN_DIR/scripts/codex_verdict_extract.sh" "$1"
}
```

(Where `$MINDSPEC_PLUGIN_DIR` is `plugins/mindspec/` resolved from wherever the plugin is embedded.) The script scans the codex `.out` log for the largest contiguous JSON object containing both `"verdict"` and `"confidence"` keys and emits it on stdout; non-zero exit means nothing extractable.

`launch_claude_sub_for_slot` spawns a `general-purpose` `Agent` with the same BRIEF + slot id + lens prompt the codex slot used, but writes its verdict JSON with `reviewer_id: "R<slot> claude-sub"` so the tally can see the family-substitution explicitly. Keep the slot name (R4 stays R4) so verdict comparability is preserved across rounds.

When deciding whether to retry codex once before substituting: don't. Empirically on lola spec-050, every codex slot that tripped the usage-limit detector stayed tripped on retry — the user's account quota refreshes hourly, not per-process. Skip straight to claude-sub.

## Working directory matters

Codex's default sandbox is `workspace-write [workdir, /tmp, $TMPDIR, /Users/Max/.codex/memories]`. The `workdir` is whatever directory you `cd` into before `codex exec`. If the panel JSON path (`<repo>/review/<panel-slug>/...`) is outside that workdir, codex's write silently fails.

**Launch convention**: always `cd <repo>` first so `<repo>/review/...` is inside the sandbox. Single-source the backgrounding via the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true` — no `&`, no `nohup`:

```bash
cd <repo>
codex exec --skip-git-repo-check < /tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<slot>.md > /tmp/codex_<panel-slug>_r<slot>.out 2>&1
```

If the panel runs in a worktree under a parent repo, `cd` to the worktree, not the parent — the worktree's `review/` subtree is where the verdict needs to land.

## Slot lens defaults

| Slot | Family | Lens |
|:-----|:-------|:-----|
| R1 | Claude | Author-of-record — diff matches plan §<bead>? |
| R2 | Claude | Codebase-pin — named files and tests actually exist + green? |
| R3 | Claude | Prompt-shape / contract stability — downstream surface stable? |
| R4 | Codex  | Empirical prober — run validators by hand |
| R5 | Codex  | Schema / type correctness — Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, unions |
| R6 | Codex  | Next-bead integration — will the next bead consume this cleanly? |

Mix to taste. The point is six distinct lenses, not six clones. For round >= 2, each slot inherits its previous-round lens and is told to evaluate only its own `concrete_changes_required` items as ADDRESSED / PARTIAL / MISSED / NEW_ISSUE, plus flagged fix-author deviations from the BRIEF.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't read `.out` files via `Read` while a codex session is still active — they grow and can overflow context. Wait for the completion notification, then grep targeted strings.
- Don't run all six reviewers as foreground tool calls — that serialises the panel and wastes 5-10 minutes.
- Don't reuse a codex `/tmp/codex_*.md` file across rounds — write a fresh one per round so the round number is unambiguous in the prompt.
- Don't ask Claude reviewers to also do the codex empirical-probe lens — duplication is worse than coverage gaps; trust the family split.
- Don't skip the `panel.json` write in step 0, or bump `round` without re-capturing `reviewed_head_sha`. The gate reads `panel.json`; a stale or missing one is a silent bypass.

## Then

Hand off to `/ms-panel-tally`.
