# Plan Approval

1. Identify the active spec/plan via `mindspec state show`
2. Run `mindspec approve plan <id>` in the terminal (validates, closes the plan-approve gate, sets state, emits guidance)
3. If approval fails, show the validation errors and help the user fix them
4. On success: run `mindspec next` to claim the first bead and enter Implementation Mode
