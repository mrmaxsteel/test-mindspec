description: Approve a plan and transition toward Implementation Mode

# Plan Approval

1. Identify the active spec/plan via `mindspec state show`
2. Run `mindspec approve plan <id>` (validates, closes the plan-approve molecule step, sets state, emits guidance)
3. If approval fails, show the validation errors and help the user fix them
4. On success: run `mindspec next` to claim the first bead and enter Implementation Mode (do NOT ask the user — just do it)
